## Problem Background

University graduates in Sri Lanka face challenges due to a growing skills gap. The World Economic Forum states that 55% of employees worldwide will need significant re-skilling by 2022. This trend emphasizes the importance of practical skills over theoretical knowledge, suggesting that real-world skills better prepare graduates for the workforce.

## Problem Statement

A platform is needed to help users identify and address skill gaps by offering personalized study materials, interactive exercises, mock interviews, progress tracking, and expert mentorship to build confidence and readiness for job interviews.

## Proposed Solution

This platform helps users prepare for job interviews by identifying, assessing, and addressing skill weaknesses. It offers resources and practice tools to ensure users feel prepared and confident in different skill areas. Features include:

- Personalized study materials
- Interactive exercises
- Realistic mock interview scenarios
- Progress tracking
- Expert tips and mentorship opportunities

Additionally, a collaborative community feature enables peer-to-peer practice interviews, forums, discussion groups, and real-time feedback. Personalized performance analytics provide insights and recommend adaptive simulations for real-world scenarios.

## Aim

This project aims to create a comprehensive platform that empowers users to effectively prepare for job interviews by identifying skill gaps, enhancing technical and soft skills, and building confidence through personalized learning, community support, and AI-driven insights.
